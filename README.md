## What is this?
I am creating a local cloud infastructure using raspberry pi's and other computers in my house.
When I started on this I had no idea what kubernetes was or what I was getting myself into.
It's really a complex subject and I won't really go into it because I don't fully understand it,
I have a couple raspberry pi's and computers and kubernetes is a way to orchestrate everything into
a mass of CPU and RAM to run containerized applications.

## What you need

You really only need one computer, or raspberry pi, or whatever. The whole point of kubernetes is 
that its very modular, which means extra computers can be added on as you get them. I added a lot of extra stuff for fun and to expirement.
