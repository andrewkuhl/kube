## What is this?
I am creating a local cloud infastructure using raspberry pi's and other computers in my house.
When I started on this I had no idea what kubernetes was or what I was getting myself into.
It's really a complex subject and I won't really go into it because I don't fully understand it,
I have a couple raspberry pi's and computers and kubernetes is a way to orchestrate everything into
a mass of CPU and RAM to run containerized applications.
